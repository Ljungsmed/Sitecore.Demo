        <p style="margin-left: 13.5pt;"><span>Our clients require a wide range of financing needs. Their business may want to grow, or restructure, or address a long-term capital need. An entrepreneur may want venture capital for a new business. An established business may want to buy or merge with a complementary business. Depending on the need, the best financing approach might be secured debt, the issuance of equity, or some other transaction. Chase Ridley attorneys bring the experience and knowledge from having successfully completed any of these wide range of solutions.</span></p>
